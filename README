This is just a utility I use to automate building custom kernels on debian stable.

custom kernels for aufs-read-write-over-root-on-cryptoloop and other insane layouts.

It uses a vagrant vm to do the actual build, then pushes the packages, as well as the initrd, vmlinux, lib/modules/tarball, and config to a stash  (mod_dav) server.
It also references other repositories on github to get patches to the kernel (aufs is unstable on the default linux kernel)

Usage: curl -k https://raw.github.com/fapestniegd/popcorn/master/bin/popcorn | /bin/bash

Or just download the same, chmod +x it and run it.

What does it do?

It will source a file in your home directory called .popcornrc (if exists) or use some defaults.



# .popcornrc example:

export KERNEL=2.6.35
export KSUBVER=13
export AUFS_BRANCH=aufs2.1-35
export GITHUB_READONLY_TOKEN="1485723c684fdf8b788fe221904891b8851ee1a5"
