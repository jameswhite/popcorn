This is just a utility I use to automate building custom kernels on debian stable.

custom kernels for aufs-read-write-over-root-on-cryptoloop and other insane layouts.

It uses a vagrant vm to do the actual build, then pushes the packages, as well as the initrd, vmlinux, lib/modules/tarball, and config to a stash  (mod_dav) server.
It also references other repositories on github to get patches to the kernel (aufs is unstable on the default linux kernel)

Usage: curl -sk https://raw.github.com/fapestniegd/popcorn/master/bin/popcorn | /bin/bash

Or just download the same, chmod +x it and run it.

What does it do?

If your hostname IS NOT 'popcorn':
  * source a file in your home directory called .popcornrc (if exists) or create one using hard-coded defaults if it doesn't exist.
  * check to see if you have vagrant and virtualbox available
  * see if you have a debian_squeeze.box in ${POPCORN_TMP} directory, downloading it if absent.
  * set the virtualbox hostname to popcorn
  * create an authorized keys file from ~/.ssh/*.pub for root on the vagrant box
  * copy .popcornrc to the vagrant box to preserve preferences across hosts
  * the script will then scp itself to the virtualbox and then ssh into the virtualbox and run itself as root
  * grab some variables from out output log (run.out) and use those to curl the resulting tarball to create a "readonly update" file from a template.
  * curl -X PUT the readonly update and kernel bundle to a stash (mod_dav) server
  * exit

If your hostname IS 'popcorn': (which is the name of the virtualbox vm we've just created)
  * download and install cfengine (optional)
  * get kernel build dependencies from apt
  
  * download the aufs-standalone 
  * 
  * echo some variables to the output log (run.out) for parsing by the script running on the host machine
